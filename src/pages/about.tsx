                    Hi I created this. I really liked what with google did with
                    proxx.app and wanted to make my own version and I also just
                    wanted to generally make games for the browser that can work
                    on muiltiple platforms. This is the first game in probably 
                    a serious of them. I don't know what Ill stop. Probably when
                    school becomes busy and maintaining this games becomes a
                    priority. Im hopping to complete some other games such as:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Minesweeper: This!!!</li>
                    <li>Layer-it: Coming soon</li>
                    <li>Tetris: Coming soon</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
